In September I started my OSCP journey. I used this subreddit a lot and I'd like to share part of my story with some advice for those who are in a similar spot than I was. I invested around 350h overall.



Background before OSCP:

- Security Pre Sales Systems Engineer for a big security vendor, with some background in Routing / Switching (CCNP)

- No offsec experience at all.

- basic understanding of programming

- decent Linux cli skills, almost no experience on Windows CLI



PWK:

The first couple weeks were really tough for me. I started with 7days reading the pdf and watching the videos. Afterwards, I started in the lab and struggled a lot. By a lot I mean, I wasn't able to root a single box for 3days. I expected something like a step by step tutorial how to approach boxes from the course material, as probably most of you know this is not a spoonfeeding course and the material basically teaches you 10-20%. I had a tough time building my own methology and how to approach boxes. A friend of mine recommended me to read some walkthroughs from HTB and Vulnhub to get an understanding of how to start and move on from the enumeration part. This helped a bit and after the first week I rooted 2 very easy boxes. From time to time I was able to improve but at a slow rate. I had some frustrating periods where I was stuck and did not understand a lot of things and by those days I feel like I reached a turning point. I discovered the discord pwk channels. This helped me a lot and it's probably my best advice to the guys who are new to this topic. I met some really cool people there and we talked quite a bit about different strategies and how to approach different things. From there on it went better and better by day. I invested around 25h a week on average into the course. My goal was 30h at least per week but I had some really busy weeks at work sometimes which didn't make it easier to put in the hours.

After 90days I rooted 33boxes and had a low shell to the big 4. I unlocked one machine in a different network but never investigated everything outside the public network.

Some of my study groups friends told me that all the exercises and lab report takes around 50-80h. I decided that I will invest that time into the lab machines.



Motivation:

The certificate was never a must-have for moving on to the next step in my career. For me, it was more important to learn the techniques for my daily life as a systems engineer to make my demos better and more attractive. I always was fascinated by hackers and wanted to understand how things actually work. That was also one of the reasons that in the end I did not really care if I fail with 65p and no lab report. I'd just have done the exam again as soon as possible.



First Exam:

I usually get up at 3am every day and go to the gym. So my gameplan was to be fresh so I decided to start at 5am. Since this was a proctored exam I needed to be there 15min earlier and to be honest offsec needs to improve a bit here. I used a 3 monitor setup (30",27",27") and run the monitor software there. I used my dedicated macbookpro for the webcam only and I was super glad I did that. The webcam stream used around 80% of my laptops cpu. Didn't matter if chrome or firefox and honestly I felt that the monitoring software made things less smooth than it usually is. Also, the stream broke at least 10 times during the day and I needed to reactivate it. On the other hand, the guys who monitor you are super nice and very patient. So if you are in the middle of something they didn't care if you wait 10min for reactivating the cam etc.



My gameplan was:

start with BoF (60min)

run scans in the meantime

go on with 10p machine

go on with 25p machine

select easier looking 20p machine.

If stuck for 2h move on to other machine

take a 5-10min break every 90min.

Everything went quite according to plan. I rooted the first machine in around 45min and took a break to drink a big smoothie. Once I came back I checked my scans and saw 4 out of 5 machines were windows based... Never the less I found an easy way to root the 10p machine and 10min later this one was done as well. I made sure I took good screenshots and edited my notes. Now at 6.30am I had 35p. Time for the 25p machine. Since my linux privesc skills are way better than windows I knew I need the full 25p here. I invested a couple hours and knew where to enter but it didn't really work out. During the lunch break I had an idea and after that 1h break I had a low shell. The privesc part was not that easy but around 2pm that machine was rooted and I had 60points. Now I need one more machine and I should be fine. On the first machine I didn't find anything for 2h so I moved on to the last 20p machine and had a low limit shell after around 30min. Since no one knows how many points you get for low priv shell I just knew that I'm either super close at passing right now or super close below passing until 8pm I enumerated between both machines to get another low priv shell or full admin. Unfortunately, I was not able to move any further. I found nothing which could even help me so I decided to go to bed. At 2am I got up, drank a big shake and went back into the exam for the last 3hours. I found some small things which might help but I did not achieve a full root or another low shell once the VPN closed at 5am.



Report

I knew that offsec takes the report very seriously and I told myself that this can be my chance to impress them in case it's a coin flip between passing and failing. I took some time off until 10pm and started with the report. I'm pretty good with documentation and after 11h with some breaks, I had a beautiful 33 page report. It might sound rather short compared to how long others report were but I'm pretty sure it was the most beautiful one they received that day :D. I made sure the report was in the right format and encrypted with the required password.

24h hours later after waking up I checked my email and received the confirmation that I passed the exam. Feelsgoodman!



Tips & Tricks

There are a lot of great OSCP summaries out there. Here are some of my favorite ones:

Initial scan for every box:

TCP: nmap -A -sV --script=default,vuln -p- --open -oA tcp_10.11.1.x 10.11.1.x

UDP: nmap -A -sV -sU --script=default,vuln --open -oA udp_10.11.1.x 10.11.1.x

https://github.com/jivoi/pentest (this is awesome!)

scan whole subnet and export .gnmap into an excel file while you are studying the materials.

Favorite 2 Summaries:

https://guif.re/linuxeop && https://guif.re/windowseop

Learn tools which are not mentioned in the pdf

burp

nikto

cadaver

showmount -e

curl (this is probably the most important tool to understand and what you can do with it)

Personal Tips (for mac / linux)

Don't use a VMware player for accessing the websites etc

forward the ports and use burp on your host system

forward the ports and use the browsers on your host system

Iterm2 with splitpane is pure gold and infinite scrolling

Record your screen during the exam, if you miss something you can go back during the reporting and take the screenshots

Take breaks!

Join the discord grp if you are not a super genius who can learn everything by yourself quickly.

Threat the whole OSCP as a video game where you move from box to box to pwn everything.

One Note is by far the best tool to take notes imo.








Yes. Go to vulnhub and download the following machines:

Mr robot

Vulnos

Kioptrix

Sickos

Braindead

Stapler

If you root it or not. I highly recommend reading the mentioned walktroughs, you will learn different techniques for the same vulnerability.

For example if you have access to a wordpress site, some people like to edit the template to get a rev shell. i usually installed a plugin to get a rev shell and now you have 2 options and in case you don't have the permission to do one of those steps you can use the other one

Here’s a list of the things you need to learn to get prepared for OSCP:

Linux and Windows Environment - You need to be familiar with both. These will help you spot clues for privilege escalation. I’m a Windows guy and during the labs, I learned Linux the hard way.
Linux and Windows Commands - Knowing Linux and Windows commands helps a lot. Brush up on them!
Basic Programming Skills - Expect to debug and rewrite exploits, so know Bash Scripting. This will help you to automate redundant tasks.
Web application attacks (SQLi, XSS, Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion, and Command Execution) - Expect a lot of web application content in the labs. Also, practice bypassing web security filters for injection attacks.
Metasploit Framework – Brush up on creating payloads with different formats, using multi handlers, and using staged vs non-staged payloads. Knowing these things will save you some time during your exam.
Nmap - Different scanning techniques and Nmap NSE Scripts will help you a lot during your lab or exam.
Netcat and Ncat - You’ll be using these a lot during the OSCP.
Wireshark and tcpdump - Those are important because you’ll be using Wireshark to debug your exploit - or tcpdump, when machines don’t have a GUI.
Windows and Linux Privilege Escalation - Aside from using kernel exploits, brush up on misconfigurations like weak service/file permissions and NFS/Shares.
Escaping restricted shells and spawning shells - You’ll encounter these a lot during your OSCP.
File transfer - It is important that you know the different techniques to transfer files to a target machine.
Aside from those topics, these books will also come in handy:

Kali Linux Revealed - To freshen up your Linux Fundamentals.
Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking - One of my favorite books. This book covers almost all the aspects of what the OSCP entails.
Web Application Hackers Handbook - I highly suggest reading this book, especially if you’re new to web application penetration testing. The book covers web application attacks from attacking access controls, application logic, and application servers.
Rtfm: Red Team Field Manual - This is a great cheat sheet for pen testers.
Hacking: The Art of Exploitation 2nd Edition - This book covers deeper knowledge about penetration testing.
