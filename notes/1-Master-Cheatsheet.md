Methodology

1) Information - WWW, Google, whois
2) Service Enumeration - VPN, SNMP, Port Scanning, DNS, SMTP
3) Penetration - BOs, SQL
4) Maintaining Access - Trojan
5) House Keeping - Cleaning Up, Rootkits

Tips & Tricks

There are a lot of great OSCP summaries out there. Here are some of my favorite ones:

Initial scan for every box:

TCP: nmap -A -sV --script=default,vuln -p- --open -oA tcp_10.11.1.x 10.11.1.x

UDP: nmap -A -sV -sU --script=default,vuln --open -oA udp_10.11.1.x 10.11.1.x

https://github.com/jivoi/pentest (this is awesome!)

scan whole subnet and export .gnmap into an excel file while you are studying the materials.

Favorite 2 Summaries:

Learn tools which are not mentioned in the pdf

burp

nikto

cadaver

showmount -e

curl (this is probably the most important tool to understand and what you can do with it)

Personal Tips (for mac / linux)

Don't use a VMware player for accessing the websites etc

forward the ports and use burp on your host system

forward the ports and use the browsers on your host system

Iterm2 with splitpane is pure gold and infinite scrolling

Record your screen during the exam, if you miss something you can go back during the reporting and take the screenshots

Take breaks!

Join the discord grp if you are not a super genius who can learn everything by yourself quickly.

Threat the whole OSCP as a video game where you move from box to box to pwn everything.

One Note is by far the best tool to take notes imo.








Yes. Go to vulnhub and download the following machines:

Mr robot

Vulnos

Kioptrix

Sickos

Braindead

Stapler

If you root it or not. I highly recommend reading the mentioned walktroughs, you will learn different techniques for the same vulnerability.

For example if you have access to a wordpress site, some people like to edit the template to get a rev shell. i usually installed a plugin to get a rev shell and now you have 2 options and in case you don't have the permission to do one of those steps you can use the other one

Linux



Compile locally

gcc -o exp 9545.c -Wl,--hash-style=both



Read bash history:

echo: .bash_history

find -name ".bash_history" -exec cat {} \;



Override /etc/passwd:

-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 1306 Apr 21 2016 /etc/passwd

Echo root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash > /etc/passwd



Default checks:

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

pkexec python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/sh')"



sudo-l

Here’s a list of the things you need to learn to get prepared for OSCP:

Linux and Windows Environment - You need to be familiar with both. These will help you spot clues for privilege escalation. I’m a Windows guy and during the labs, I learned Linux the hard way.
Linux and Windows Commands - Knowing Linux and Windows commands helps a lot. Brush up on them!
Basic Programming Skills - Expect to debug and rewrite exploits, so know Bash Scripting. This will help you to automate redundant tasks.
Web application attacks (SQLi, XSS, Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion, and Command Execution) - Expect a lot of web application content in the labs. Also, practice bypassing web security filters for injection attacks.
Metasploit Framework – Brush up on creating payloads with different formats, using multi handlers, and using staged vs non-staged payloads. Knowing these things will save you some time during your exam.
Nmap - Different scanning techniques and Nmap NSE Scripts will help you a lot during your lab or exam.
Netcat and Ncat - You’ll be using these a lot during the OSCP.
Wireshark and tcpdump - Those are important because you’ll be using Wireshark to debug your exploit - or tcpdump, when machines don’t have a GUI.
Windows and Linux Privilege Escalation - Aside from using kernel exploits, brush up on misconfigurations like weak service/file permissions and NFS/Shares.
Escaping restricted shells and spawning shells - You’ll encounter these a lot during your OSCP.
File transfer - It is important that you know the different techniques to transfer files to a target machine.
Aside from those topics, these books will also come in handy:

Kali Linux Revealed - To freshen up your Linux Fundamentals.
Penetration Testing: A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking - One of my favorite books. This book covers almost all the aspects of what the OSCP entails.
Web Application Hackers Handbook - I highly suggest reading this book, especially if you’re new to web application penetration testing. The book covers web application attacks from attacking access controls, application logic, and application servers.
Rtfm: Red Team Field Manual - This is a great cheat sheet for pen testers.
Hacking: The Art of Exploitation 2nd Edition - This book covers deeper knowledge about penetration testing.
